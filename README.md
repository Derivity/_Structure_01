# What is Derivity

## What is Derivity

### Purpose&#x20;

This page defines what Derivity is at a system level and the problem it exists to solve in real world.

### Description

Derivity is a multi-agent financial decision-intelligence system designed to support structured reasoning under uncertainty.

It does not provide financial advice, does not execute trades, and does not act on behalf of users. Instead, it helps users understand situations, risks, trade-offs, and possible scenarios through controlled reasoning.

### What Makes Derivity Different&#x20;

Derivity separates:

* reasoning from data
* intelligence from authority
* confidence from correctness

All outputs are explainable, auditable, and safety-governed.

### Non-Goals

Derivity does not:

* generate trading signals
* guarantee outcomes
* replace human judgment
* optimize for engagement
