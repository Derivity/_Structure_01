## Product Vision

### Purpose

This page defines the long-term vision behind Derivity and the guiding intent of the system.

### Vision Statement

Derivity exists to bring structured, explainable reasoning into financial decision-making.

The system is designed to help users:

* understand complex financial situations
* reason through uncertainty and risk
* explore trade-offs and scenarios
* make informed decisions independently

Derivity does not aim to replace human judgment. It aims to improve the quality of that judgment.

### Design Priorities

Derivity prioritizes:

* correctness over speed
* explainability over confidence
* safety over persuasion
* long-term trust over short-term engagement
