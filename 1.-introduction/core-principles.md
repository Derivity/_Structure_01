# Core Principles

## Core Principles

### Purpose

This page lists non-negotiable principles that guide all design and engineering decisions.

### Principles

1. No hallucinated confidence
2. All outputs must be explainable
3. Uncertainty must be explicit&#x20;
4. Unsafe requests must be refused
5. Agents must be isolated and controlled
6. The LLM is replaceable; architecture is not

### Enforcement

Any feature or output that violates these principles is considered a system defect and must be corrected at the architectural level.
